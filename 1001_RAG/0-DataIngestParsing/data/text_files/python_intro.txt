What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for many types of software development. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features of Python

Easy to Learn and Read

Python’s syntax is simple and resembles human language, which makes it beginner-friendly.

Example:

print("Hello, World!")


Interpreted Language

Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter.

No need to compile code before running it.

Dynamically Typed

You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.

x = 10      # integer
x = "Hello" # string


Versatile and Multi-Paradigm

Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.

Large Standard Library and Ecosystem

Comes with built-in modules for tasks like file handling, networking, and math.

Thousands of third-party packages (like numpy, pandas, langchain) extend its functionality.

Cross-Platform

Python works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile platforms.

Where Python is Used
